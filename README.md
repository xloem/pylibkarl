Practice for using a personal library.

I start this library with the idea of using functions that return bool as type specifiers. I like this idea.

Explaining more behind the structure will help improve the library, which is intended to be concise and reusable in the utmost way, but this may have to wait until I work through my psychological issues better.

It is fine to add anything to this library.

When bored, refactoring this or adding sugar or such to it could be something to do.
